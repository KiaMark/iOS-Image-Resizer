## Resize Png Images
ResizeImage takes a text file filled with different sizes and converts a png picture to the sizes indicated.

## How to Run
1. Start by checking if you have all the neccessary components in one folder
	(text file with the new sizes, a png image, and an output folder where all the new resized pictures will go.)
2. Run the program in a command prompt
3. Follow the commanded inputs asking for the file and picture names. 
	(Be sure to include the extension for the text file and the png image) 
4. Once all the neccessay info is inputed, the program will inform you if any of the resized images will decrease in quality
	due to an increase of size compared to the original image.
5. Check your indicated output file for the resized images.
